## How does it know what to search?

Many CMS and website generators use the `q` query parameter in the URL to indicate a search. This is the ubiquitous way to indicate search on websites. For example, searching for `orange` would produce a URL like `example.com/search?q=orange`.

It's possible to use another parameter if your site is configured differently. Just replace the `q` in `getUrlParam("q")` with your desired parameter, eg `getUrlParam("search")`.

## How does it work?

The snippet is divided into 3 sections.

- [Attachment Point](#attachment-point)
- [Javascript](#javascript)
- [Styling](#styling)

Each section will talk about how it contributes to the interface.

### Attachment point

This is the place at which the results will display. You can place this anywhere in your html, just make sure this appears before the [Javascript](#javascript) is loaded.

You can also skip this part and have the javascript attach to something that already exists on the page. More info in the [Javascript](#javascript) section.

```html
<div id="search-results"></div>
```

### Javascript

This section is responsible for performing the integration and searching.

It performs 2 tasks.

1. Set up the values for the search.
2. Pull in the search code that will perform the work of searching and displaying results.

#### Configuring

To direct the search into your data replace `<PROJECT>` and `<COLLECTION>` with your project and collection.

To enable a search box above the results for instance search, set `searchBox` to `true`. Set to `false` to remove it.

To attach to different element (Not the element supplied in [Attachment point](#attachment-point)), replace the value of `attachTarget` with the your element.

### Styling

The style element includes some basic styling for the results.

If you wish to do the styling yourself there are classes on the html elements generated by the interface.
