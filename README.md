**sajari-react** is a library of React Components for the [Sajari](https://www.sajari.com) search platform to help build fast and powerful search interfaces.

React provides a simple and elegant way to structure user interfaces. The Sajari React SDK provides a way to seamlessly integrate the Sajari platform into any React app through the use of easily composable Components.

We also provide a vanilla Sajari JS library [here](https://github.com/sajari/sajari-sdk-js/).

## Setup

### NPM

```
npm install --save sajari sajari-react
```

## Examples

### [Site Search Integration](./examples/basic-site-integration/)

The [site search integration](./examples/basic-site-integration/) is the fastest way to get an interface on your website.

## License

We use the [MIT license](./LICENSE)

## Browser Support

The browser support is dependent on the React library, which currently supports recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Sajari, Opera, and IE9+. (17/8/2016)
