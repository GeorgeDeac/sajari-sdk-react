# Sajari React SDK

`@sajari/sdk-react` is a client side javascript library of React Components for the
[Sajari](https://www.sajari.com) search platform to help build fast and powerful search interfaces.

React provides a simple and elegant way to structure user interfaces.
The Sajari React SDK provides a way to seamlessly integrate the Sajari platform
into any web-based app through the use of easily composable Components.

We also provide a vanilla Sajari JS library [here](https://github.com/sajari/sajari-sdk-js/).

## Setup

If you want to add the SDK to an existing project, or want to start from scratch, then you can get `@sajari/sdk-react` using NPM.

We currently distribute the `@sajari/sdk-react` library through NPM. NPM is only required for downloading the library. The SDK is made to be used from the browser.

```shell
$ npm install --save @sajari/sdk-react
```
